# AggregateKit ORM

A DDD-friendly ORM using the Data Mapper pattern, focused on aggregate persistence.

## Features (planned)
- Data Mapper-style persistence
- Aggregate root enforcement (DDD-style)
- Clean separation between write & read models
- Full memory cleanup for long-running PHP processes
- Plain PHP mapping configuration

## Installation (once released)

composer require aggregatekit/orm
